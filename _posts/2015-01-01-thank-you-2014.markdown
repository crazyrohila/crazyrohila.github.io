In 2013 I mostly worked as front-end developer, so I was hoping same for 2014. I loved working on front-end stuff, so I decided to move on that direction. But I was assigned as Drupal-developer in projects last year. I improved a lot in back-end stuff, I have tried things I was afraid of. I have gained confidence as drupal/back-end developer.
I didn't meet my front-end goals, but improved a lot as full-stack developer.

Other Thing is, I moved to GOA in May. Traveled almost all of south Goa, which I liked very much (not a fan of north Goa except Arambol beach). I went on a [South India trip](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=771757122862762&set=a.100258870012594.335.100000854434492 "South India Trip") with colleagues. This was my first time in south India, loved Kerala. Here are some pictures (https://www.flickr.com/photos/crazyrohila/).

Few other things from last year are:

* I learned to swim.
* Bought a Gym-kit, gained some weight.
* Learned to drive (beginner level).
* Learned to cook (beginner level).
* Been on plane for first time :P.

Overall Last year was fun. I improved in lots of things, but wasted lots of time. Hope to do better in 2015.

This year I want to:

* Work on side projects and Write posts
* Work on communication skills
* Do Exercise, Be fit
* Save money
